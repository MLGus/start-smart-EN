# start-smart-EN
Start Smart. Don’t start from scratch. Don’t get lost. Don’t repeat mistakes. Start with clarity, structure, and strategy.

ou know that moment when you’re not sure where to start?  
Wishing you had a roadmap or a starter framework to kick off your startup, project, or documentation?

I’ve been there — many times over the past 25 years.  
That’s why I decided to compile some **best practices and proven frameworks** into simple templates that are easy to use and adapt.

I’m sharing them with the community so more people can start with **clarity, speed, and confidence** — and hopefully improve them even further.

---
📢 I’ve just created and published a set of documentation templates to help streamline strategy and project execution:

- 🧠 **01 Strategic Management and Analysis Tools**    
- 📝 **02 Project Planning Guide**    
- 🗂️ **03 Project Executive Summary**    
- ✅ **04 Kick-Off - Project Scope Definition**

These templates were born out of real needs in tech and AI projects I've led — where clarity, alignment, and speed are critical. They’re designed to save time, guide decisions, and keep teams focused on what matters.

**Made with ❤️ to help people and companies think with clarity.**

If I missed anything or you’d like to dive deeper into the documentation and its features, feel free to drop a comment or reach out (on X, Medium, Substack, or LinkedIn) — let’s discuss!

Check them out, fork them, adapt them — and let me know what you'd improve.
